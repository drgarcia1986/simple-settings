Python Simple Settings
======================
A simple way to manage your project settings.

**simple-settings** is inspired by Django's settings system but is generic for any python project.

With simple-settings you just need to specify your settings module using the `--settings` commandline arg when
invoking your python script (or `SIMPLE_SETTINGS` environment var) and all settings will be exposed as properties of the
`simple_settings.settings` module.

```python
>>> from simple_settings import settings
>>> print(settings.FOO)
'some value in foo'
```

## Installation
simple-settings is available on [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simple-settings).

```bash
$ pip install simple-settings
```

> To install simple-settings with all dependencies use `pip install simple-settings[all]`

## How this works

simple-settings reads and stores all variables (or constants if you prefer) of a python module that you specify.
To store your settings you need at least one python module.
The objects in this python module, work as a mapping to settings of project, because, for each object in this module,
simple-settings will seek it's value in environment before assuming the value presenting in module.

To specify your settings module you have two approaches: with command line or environment.

For example, imagine that you have a python module for your project settings and this file is in "_settings/development.py_" (a common example).
To load settings of this file you can run your project with command line arg `--settings`:

```bash
$ python app.py --settings=settings.development

```
> simple-settings accepts `--simple-settings` command line arg also

Or set the environment variable `SIMPLE_SETTINGS`:

```bash
$ export SIMPLE_SETTINGS=settings.development
$ python app.py
```

> the `settings` environment variable is deprecated

The `simple_settings.settings` object reads the command line and environment in this order (but simple-settings takes first value it encounters), to know which file to load.

Another option is use class `LazySettings` instead singleton object `settings`.
With `LazySettings` class is possible to determine settings files in object create:
```python
from simple_settings import LazySettings


settings = LazySettings('settings.development')
```
If you don't pass any value in _LazySettings_ init argument, this class follow the same behavior of _settings_ object.


## Example
This is a very dummy example, in real world you would use simple-settings in more complex cases.

### **project_settings.py**

In this example we just store a simple string but any python type is accepted.

```python
SIMPLE_CONF = 'simple'
```
### **app.py**

You don't need specify which setting _simple-settings_ must load, you can do this with command line or environment.

```python
from simple_settings import settings

print(settings.SIMPLE_CONF)
```
### **Run**

You can specify your settings module with command line:
```bash
$ python app.py --settings=project_settings
simple
```
Or environment:
```bash
$ export SIMPLE_SETTINGS=project_settings
$ python app.py
simple
```

Check [examples](https://github.com/drgarcia1986/simple-settings/tree/master/examples), in project repository for more usage samples.

## as_dict()
You can check the loaded settings through method `settings.as_dict()`
```python
>>> settings.as_dict()
{'SIMPLE_CONF': 'simple'}
```

## configure
You can change any settings (and add new settings) in runtime with method `configure`:
```python
>>> settings.SOME_CONF
foo
>>> settings.configure(SOME_CONF='bar')
>>> settings.SOME_CONF
bar
```

> If your use `dynamic settings` _configure_ method update changed setting value in dynamic storage too.

## Types of settings
The simple-settings is prepared to play with the following files types:

* python modules.
* cfg files (simple `key=value` files).
* yaml files.
* json files.

> To simple-settings load settings of yaml files is necessary install with extras require _yaml_ ex: `pip install simple-settings[yaml]`

## Load multiple settings modules
simple-settings can load more than one setting module without use import approach, just specify yours settings modules separated by comma.
For example:
```bash
$ python app.py --settings=production,amazon,new_relic
```
simple-setting will load all settings modules in order that was specified (`production`-> `amazon` -> `new_relic`) overriding possibles conflicts.

This also work with _LazySettings_ class:
```python
from simple_settings import LazySettings


settings = LazySettings('production', 'amazon', 'new_relic')
```
You can combine any type of settings (_python modules_, _yaml_, etc.).

## Ignored settings
* Python modules:
	* Variables starting with `_`.
* Cfg files:
	* Keys starting with `#`.

## Special Settings
simple-settings has a list of _special settings_ that change how settings will load settings.
This _special settings_ are specified using a `SIMPLE_SETTINGS` dict in the settings module.

```python
SIMPLE_SETTINGS = {
    'OVERRIDE_BY_ENV': True,
    'REQUIRED_SETTINGS': ('API_TOKEN', 'DB_USER'),
    'DYNAMIC_SETTINGS': {
        'backend': 'redis',
        'pattern': 'DYNAMIC_*',
        'auto_casting': True
    }
}
```
_Note: special settings may only be specified in python settings files (not ini, yaml, etc.)._

### Override settings value
You can override the values of your settings module with environment variables.
You just need set the _special setting_ `OVERRIDE_BY_ENV` with `True` as value.

```bash
$ export SIMPLE_CONF="simple from env"
$ python app.py --settings=project_settings
simple from env
```

> This is not a dynamic behavior, because settings is only override in _"settings setup"_ time, see `dynamic settings` for a real dynamic behavior.

### Required Settings
You can determine a list of mandatory settings, i.e. settings that require a valid value.
For this, set the _sepecial setting_ `REQUIRED_SETTINGS` with a list (or any iterable) of yours required settings.
If any setting of this list have an invalid value (or it's not present in setting file) a `ValueError` is raised with a list of required settings not satify in settings file.

### Dynamic Settings
simple-settings has a list of _dynamic settings_ mechanisms that change a value of setting dynamically.<br>
If dynamic setting is activate, for all setting the dynamic reader is called.<br>
The current dynamic mechanisms suported is:

#### Default Dynamic Settings Configuration
For all _dynamic settings_ backends _simple-settings_ accept this optional parameters:
* `pattern`: if you set some pattern the dynamic settings reader only get settings that match with this pattern.
* `auto_casting`: if you set this conf to `True` (default is `False`) _simple settings_ use
[jsonpickle](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle) to encode settings value before save in dynamic storage
and decode after read from dynamic storage. With this bahavior you can use complex types (like _dict_ and _list_)
in dynamic settings.

#### Redis
You can read your settings dynamically in redis if you activate the `DYNAMIC_SETTINGS` special setting with `redis` backend:
```python
SIMPLE_SETTINGS = {
    'DYNAMIC_SETTINGS': {
        'backend': 'redis',
        'host': 'locahost',
        'port': 6379,
    }
}
```
> for `redis` backend `localhost` is default value for `host` and `6379` is the default value for `port`.

In redis dynamic reader the binary types is automatically decoded.

> To install with redis dependencies use: `pip install simple-settings[redis]`

#### Consul
You can read your settings dynamically form a consul server if you activate the `DYNAMIC_SETTINGS` special setting
with the `consul` backend (uses [consulate](https://github.com/gmr/consulate) library):
```python
SIMPLE_SETTINGS = {
    'DYNAMIC_SETTINGS': {
        'backend': 'consul',
        'host': 'locahost',
        'port': 8500
    }
}
```
> for `consul` backend `localhost` is default value for `host` and `8500` is the default value for `port`.

Additional attributes for consul backend: `datacenter`, `token`, `scheme`

> To install with consul dependencies use: `pip install simple-settings[consul]`

#### DATABASE
You can read your settings dynamically form a database if you activate the `DYNAMIC_SETTINGS` special setting
with the `database` backend (uses [sqlalchey](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/) library)

```python
SIMPLE_SETTINGS = {
    'DYNAMIC_SETTINGS': {
        'backend': 'database',
        'sqlalchemy.url': 'sqlite:///:memory:',
        ...
    }
}
```

> To install with database dependencies use: `pip install simple-settings[database]`

## Utils
### Settings Stub
A simple context manager (and decorator) class useful in tests which is necessary to change some setting in the safe way.

#### Context Manager example
```python
from simple_settings import settings
from simple_settings.utils import settings_stub


with settings_stub(SOME_SETTING='foo'):
    assert settings.SOME_SETTING == 'foo'
assert settings.SOME_SETTING == 'bar'
```

#### Decorator example
```python
from simple_settings import settings
from simple_settings.utils import settings_stub


@settings_stub(SOME_SETTING='foo')
def get_some_setting():
    return settings.SOME_SETTING

assert get_some_setting() == 'foo'
assert settings.SOME_SETTING == 'bar'
```
